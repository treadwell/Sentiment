239,Order Management,,,CSOM McGraw Hill Account-2014,ric.anderson,"I usually work with Leslie Newell & Ashley Burge and they are both very professional and great to work with. Not recently but in the past I have had some problems with PO's being lost between Leslie Newell and the order entry side of things. Last year I had a conference call with Angie Davis, Trina Banks and Ashley Burge and we talked about how to address this issue. Within that meeting I asked that I start receiving confirmations when our PO's were keyed. It started out where I was receiving pretty regular confirmation e-mails but that has dropped off a little and sometimes I have to e-mail and ask about PO's. For example the 03-05-14 PO's that you have noted above, we did not receive a confirmation so I had one of my people e-mail on 3-12 and ask for an update. He didn't receive a response so I e-mailed on 3-14 and I immediately received a response from Ashley Burge. There were a total of 4 PO's, 2 of which were large stock orders but the other 2 PO's were very small (3 titles each) so those should have been able to be keyed quickly I would guess. I have set a goal for my inventory analyst who tracks these PO's to have a note in the system for these within 7-days of the send date on the PO. We send PO's every Wednesday so by the next Wednesday if he hasn't heard anything, he's going to have to e-mail for an update. Maybe I'm not giving you enough time and if that's the case, please let me know and I can make adjustments on my end. All in all I'm very happy with you guys, I appreciate everything that you do for us. I took over the inventory manager position within our company a few weeks ago and I just want to make sure that everything goes smoothly for the upcoming busy season and beyond. Thanks, please let me know if there is anything I can do on my end to make things work more efficiently.

My emails were creating using my schools' FirstClass email software. Concern 2: It took 11 days to get a response to what, in hindsight, seems like an standard question. I got multiple emails asking me for additional information/data that were irrelevant to solving the problem. Concern 3: I received two slightly different responses to my question. They are similar, but not exactly the same in terms of detailing what student must do in order to have their game data saved. --- My question asked why, when students play online games, their data is not always saved and visible in the Detailed Student Report section of your website. In the end, here are two different answers I got: Answer 1: When a student is playing a game and earn points they have to totally complete the game in order for the data to be saved. They have to click on finished or play again, the game cannot time out or cannot be put on a time limit by the teacher or it will not save the data or the points that the student has earned. Answer 2: The issue you are describing typically happens when students close the application without logging out; this can lead to data loss. To prevent this, just be sure your students are clicking ""Log Out"" prior to closing out of Everyday Math. --- I feel like neither of these answers is completely correct. It seems like the student has to end the game by clicking the appropriate button in the game interface. The student also has to select ?no thanks? at the ?Play again?? prompt. If the student uses the browser?s ?close window? button at either of these points, the data is not saved. I do not think the student has to complete the game and I do not think the student has to Log Out in order for data to be saved. The games can be useful as practice for students. The detailed student reports are cumbersome to read when data is saved. I would prefer to see data saved without the student having to be as particular about how they end their game/session.",1,1,1,Yes,"Q: A student played an online game. The game shows up in their Detailed Student Report ""Game"" select list, but there is no session or the session shows no data. A: In order for a data to be saved, the student must end the game from within the game window. If the student closes the browser window without ending the game, the data will not be saved.

I have had to deal with damaged and missing books, returns, several different sales reps, customer service agents and credit agents, none of whom seem to know their jobs. In dealing with most of the reps at least an effort was made to aid in the situation but then left your company before any resolution could be found. In dealing with the credit department not only was the representative rude and very unhelpful, he was impossible to understand since English not a first language. I feel that it was really unnecessary for not one but two Dunning letters to be sent out by him while the situation was continuing to be dealt with. The time and effort on my part and on the part of other staff members involved was extensive. My best suggestion for McGraw Hill would be to have more pride in your company from the top down. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to use McGraw Hill for certain purchases and will have to continue to use McGraw Hill, however, any items I can find elsewhere, will be purchased elsewhere.",1,1,1,No,,1,1,Adjustments,Damaged,Terri,Terri Avon,4417150,6/5/14,Phone,,,,,,,,

I emailed back asking for assistance again and since it was the weekend i was told to contact IT tech support on monday during normal business hours. I spoke to a rep on Monday (9/15) who was not able to help at all. All he told me was EXACTLY what the rep who i chatted with via email over the weekend. When i told him just that, he then suggested i speak to customer service. He told me he would transfer me, and in return i was hung up on. I had to call back myself and spent 10 minutes in the vru trying to get to the correct place. FINALLY i got a rep by the name of Anthony from customer service who was not the nicest reps. He barely let me speak, kept cutting me off, and was all around not very helpful. I explained to him that not only was i not happy but i was showing via my banking acct that i had 2 pending charges (totaling $118) from MGH edu and he rudely told me that one was a charge and the other was a pre-auth and that to get the mh campus i needed, i would have to purchase the one i needed and wait for the pending auth to fall off. I explained to him that with the current $118 already being held + another $59 ($177 total) is alot and i could not afford to do it that way. I then asked if there was something else that could be done and he told me no. I asked to speak with a sup, he told me that he didn't know why i needed to speak with one since they were just going to tell me the same thing. He then told me that no sups were available. I asked for him to take my contact info and have one call me as soon as possible to rectify. He told me that he did not know when one would be able to call me back as to you all do not have turn around times for supervisors to call back. Which i feel is inaccurate as to all places of business, have a turnaround time. I then decided that i would call back to see if i could get someone else and i did, John. John was great! He listened to me and was very very helpful. After a stressful situation, he was definitely able to turn it around and make it into a positive one. He was able to get me the product i needed which i greatly appreciate it! Thanks John YOU ROCK!!! I am extremely satisfied with John's support! Wish the other reps were as knowledgeable and helpful.

You guys expect someone to notice that 26 pages of a 2000+ page book within 30 days. Unfortunately in a book of this type you don't find out that the printing or binding process is faulty until you're attempting to reference those pages. This is absurd. Spending so much on a book you would expect it to be of excellent quality. Unfortunately you guys publish a large portion of the books that I am required to purchase.

The single sign-on error has not been resolved. I have run into it every time I've tried to log in to the ADS this morning. I am trying to convince over 100 teachers in my district that this ADS should be used daily; many are resistant to doing so and this is not helping. I am working with principals to be sure this initiative is implemented at their schools. I cannot insist that people invest their time battling a system that is not working properly. We have invested a good bit of money in the deluxe E-Suite and I am disappointed that technical glitches are making things far more difficult than they need to be. In addition to the single sign-on error, we are having trouble logging on in the afternoons in every school I've visited.

1125,Customer Service/DEOP,SE,US-ELHI PRIVATE SCHOOLS,Grace Day School,Katherine Licari,"In August, we received a shipment of books that was sent in error. I was asked by our sales representative to send a copy of a BOCES order form to her and mistakenly sent it to the ordering fax number with instructions that the fax should be delivered to our her. Within about a minute, I realized what happened and contacted customer service to have the order stopped. (Which should not have been mistaken for an order because there were other publishers listed on it and there was no purchase order included.) I was assured by customer service that the order would be pulled and, in the unlikely event that it went through, we would be able to send it back without any issue. For the last two months, I have been trying to get the ""labels"" to send back the shipment. Finally, last week I spoke with Leila who found that a case number was never issued. If memory serves, she is the third person I've spoken to about returning the books. I was quite upset when I learned about this, and although I've been very pleased about working with my sales rep (who answered about a zillion questions I had for her in a very timely manner) and with the fine new reading series we've purchased, I really wondered how this was able to slip through the cracks. Leila was wonderful and took care of the situation in a very short period of time. I've been contacted by the shipping company and expect that they will pick the books up early this week. Thank you, thank you, Leila! I think Leila is to be commended for her ability to provide a remedy for this situation -- which I repeat should not have been a situation. She was efficient and knowledgeable and took care of it as fast as she could. Bravo, Leila! As for the rest of the folks I spoke with, they were all pleasant, but did not provide the follow up that I was waiting for. We are now in receipt of a bill of more than $5,000 for books we didn't want and have been unable to return. I sent an email to a Mr. Mohammed the other day to see how to resolve that issue, but I've yet to hear back. From what I was told, the office was closed because of a holiday. Thank you for your time.

1145,Online Implementation,,US-JOB CORP/PRIVATE INDUSTRY,CHRISTIAN WOMENS JOB CORPS,Amy Cleary,"I used the Powerup program to prepare my students for the GED exam. I believe the first issue I ran into was a bug where the Typing Web link didn't work on several student accounts. This issue was not resolved in a timely manner. To be honest, I'm not sure it was ever resolved. We found a work around by using Typing Web independent of Powerup. However, the Typing Web application had so many pop-ups that we had to discontinue using it. When we disabled the pop-ups, Typing Web became unusable. Rapid Typing is available as freeware and worked adequately for our class needs. Secondly, the Powerup narration is too lengthy. Back stories are not necessary for training and use up valuable class time (& put students to sleep!). I found free sample test downloads on the GED web site that addressed our need. My favorite Powerup tool was the interactive calculator. However, now that GED administrators may allow calculators in the testing area, most of our students will default to the handheld device rather than the onscreen calculator tool. All the Powerup screens had a professional look and feel to them. The screens were easy to navigate with only one exception. This one 'hiccup' seemed to catch most people, even my volunteers with college degrees and years of experience using computers. I had to call tech support to understand how to move forward through this part of the application. The first level of support couldn't answer my question and it took awhile to find someone who could address the issue. All the customer support staff was friendly and professional even if they didn't have the answers I needed. I'm sorry to say that I have recommended our non-profit organization not to renew our license. I have the utmost respect for McGraw Hill and the software developers for this product.

I asked to speak to someone in that department but there was ""not a phone line to that department"". (So obviously, that dept did not try to contact me via phone to verify if it was a duplicate order.) Then I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told I would have to contact them via email. I was already using my own time to contact the company regarding the order. Now I have to spend more time contacting a supervisor. I was told someone would contact me within 24 hours about my case. That did not happen either. I did however, receive the order within 48 hours. But there was a price difference between the original order and the new order. I again had to spend time from my day to contact the company questioning this. For this to be a company that deals with schools/education, there is an extreme lack of support and availability.

1306,Customer Service/DEOP,,,CSOM McGraw Hill Account-2014-1,janismckaybabcock,"From a former business owner and a former Customer Service Professional- I am completely shocked at how painful this site is for end users. I tried to go through a local representative to place my order and avoid the three hour drama my friend Andrea went through in trying to order materials from you, but the rep had NO interest in speaking with me, even when asked by a former employee of yours!! That person needs immediate reprimand for unwillingness to do their job and sell their product, no matter how small the order may be. Unbelievable. Please check out your iScience Course 1 page for instance. How confusing can your product descriptions be? Look at the pricing, how does that make sense? I realize a bulk of your orders come from a human representative, but when they refuse to have even a phone conversation with a Home Education person like me I am stuck on this confusing site. Then, in October of 2014 after THREE cumulative hours on the phone, I did order from the site with Elizabeth in your customer service department on the phone and told her EXACTLY what I wanted, she gave me the ISBN numbers and I ended up with an incomplete order- not having my online subscription a part of it. Then I spent my 4th and beginning of 5th hour on the phone with you guys AGAIN last week- after being put on hold for 28 minutes by a very curt and rude Vanessa or Vajetta on 12/1 who should really not have a job in customer service! I was shocked by her resistance and attitude, totally amazed. Then after hanging up on her 28 minute wait I spoke with a rational and professional Tom who opened an case and promised the issue was resolved. After not receiving this email with code on it that he promised in the time frame he promised, I HAD TO CALL AGAIN on 12/3 and I spoke with a very professional Carlton who calmly made sure the problem was resolved, despite me having to pay way to much for something that Elizabeth messed up in the first place. He told me I would have my Master Code to Connect Ed in a day or two and I never received it. I called AGAIN today on 12/9 only to find out that the code takes up to two weeks to deliver. Why on earth would it take two weeks to process a code that was supposed to be ordered in the first place?! You guys don't seem to have a concrete plan or any sort of training on how to service the individual customer. Your reputation among the ever growing home Education crowd is deplorable, yet I was impressed with curriculum and armed with a brilliant Dr friend who already went through her 3 hour phone drama with you all, so I thought this would be easy. I was way wrong here. Now in Minnesota we have over 17,000 Home Educated kids and you would be wise to adapt to that market. First off, I'd recommend telling your local rep how much they have messed with the wrong Home Education parent, myself- one who is a leader in our community. They should probably reach out and apologize for their deplorable lack of customer care that has resulted in greatly offending my colleagues and myself. I have had no issues discussing their choice which will no doubt result in fewer sales for you all. Another step you could take is to make this website easily understandable for the one time user. Furthermore, arm your customer service employees with direct and individual sales training. Your management offered ridiculous solutions to solving the problems which leads me to realize you have a larger customer service department issue at hand (Suggesting I mail ALL my materials back, then they would resend the order? That incredulous solution was one of many silly responses and poor Carlton was left with by your management, essentially an inability to solve the situation to my satisfaction, he was FINALLY allowed to offer the ConnectEd subscription for half price.)

It would seem that many people are very offended which is how I first came across it. The response I've received is a joke, you state:"" In the case of the GMO references in Science A Closer Look, the intention was to inform students as to why some farmers currently use GMO?s on their crops"". If you are going to present this to children, you should also present the FACT that 20+ countries have altogether BANNED the use of GMO's. You should also state the FACTS that the chemicals used on GMO seeds cause tumors and cancer. And not only are there tons of health concerns, like our offspring not being able to have children because the gene that is changed in the food stop it from procreating stays alive in our bodies and could turn our reproductive genes off. I could go on and on... Does your textbook mention that Monsanto is the cause of 250,000 Indian Farmers committing suicide from failed crops after monsanto promised them ""more food, less bugs', then had the farmers go into debt to purchase the chemical roundup and then all the crops failed... Gee... seems to me that you've forgot to mention a lot about GMO's that kids might want to know. Just to make sure you don't make another critical error, here are some references for you to read up on.

We have not received any of the desk copies for our four courses and we are already in the second week of the winter quarter. So last week I called the Customer Service Dept. hoping to get the status of at least the Fundamentals of Electric Circuits by Alexander and Sadiku desk copies. The Customer Service person (I didn't write her name for reference) said that she would send the desk copies. Today my supervisor asked me to get a tracking number so we would know when to receive the desk copies. Unfortunately, my phone calls to the Customer Service desk were dropped when talking to the representatives. In case the phone problem was on our side at the University of CA, Irvine, I used my cell phone and was able to talk with Donna who saw no record of desk copies being sent to us and processed our request.

McGraw has not shipped out books that I ordered over 2 weeks ago. What is the purpose of ordering books through an automated system when a representative has to take it out pending status which was never done by Emily Platt. The excuse I was given is that she is new and she is still being trained for the job. This is unacceptable when people are depending on her or supervisor to their job. To date I still have not received my books from McGraw.

You hand the clerk the shoes, and they say, ""sorry, we can't give you a refund and we can't give you back these shoes because of our returns policy."" This just comes across as theft. The returns policy regarding customs should be revised because it just isn't right. The answer I got was that they understood my issue, but I have to contact my sales rep for further action.

The issue has just been ongoing & required me to call in many times. I originally ordered 2 desk copies of a textbook (1 for professor & 1 for TA). Only 1 arrived. I am not sure if only 1 was approved at that time or what happened. Would like to be contacted when an order or order amount will be different than what I request. Then I called in to put in another order of the book for the TA. I was never told anything about this order. When I called in weeks later, I am told there is no order for the book in the system, so I go through it with another rep & get it ordered (I was told today that the request was denied since it probably looked like a duplicated order- it wasn't a duplicate. Communication about the order would have been helpful at this point as well. I called in again on 2/12 to check the status of my order & was told that it was shipped 2/11. I finally called to check in again today & was told it was delivered to another building on campus that I do not know. I had to research this address & find department contacts there. They informed me that they sent it back because they did not recognize the name on the package. We have never given an address other than 810 S. Wright St. Room 105 Urbana, IL 61801. Every time I have requested a desk copy, this is the address they confirm with me, so I am unsure how the other address was entered for the order. I guess, the bottom line is that it is almost 6 weeks into the semester & the TA does not have a copy of the book for the discussion section of the course. Communication at different points in my ordering process would have helped relieve a lot of confusion & frustration.

The term 'Suspended' was used along with the reason of non-payment. To the receiver the term meant the on-line product was turned off or no longer available. Later in phone conversation the representative explained 'suspended' was not 'terminated' and that the product was still in use until the payment issue was resolved. The payment comment could have been worded differently. Instead of non-payment perhaps payment clarification is requested. The payment issue was referred to the credit department, however, as the payment was made in September and we are in March, why was this not resolved by the credit department many many months ago. The non-payment posting from a check that cleared the bank in September made extra work for several people here at the school district and put a couple people in an upset mode to hear the product was suspended especially when we are looking to order the product for next year. This played into another issue with McGraw over getting a refund for materials returned. It took from September until now to obtain over $25,000.00 in various refunds. We order from McGraw continually, and pay timely. Yet I now know of two situations, and that is only me in our large school district, where the Credit Department has been the reason to initiate extra research on our part, lack of response from the Credit Dept. involvement of several levels of people, only to determine the Credit Dept. holds processing up.

While the Flex license seats had been ordered by my district, we had never been alerted to it, no training was offered and we did not receive login information. I was not informed that my login for the pilot was the same. I had no idea the order had gone through and had not used the program all year. Melissa understood this and put in for reimbursement which was approved. My experience with communication from your sales reps last summer and this fall was very poor. Paul Hicking did not return emails or phone calls. Carol Cohen was initially helpful and made all sorts of promises. She met with us and explained that she was new to intervention but was eager to learn. She told me how good a sales rep she was more than once. I actually knew more about Flex from my pilot then she did. She sent some samples for me to preview but they did not meet my needs as they were too young. I never did receive a quote for Flex teacher materials despite emails and phone messages. I ended up using an on-line program from a different company and am very satisfied with their sales rep and support staff.

Our school requested sample copies of Social Studies curriculum materials. We received 10 books, along with a packing list. None of the items were marked with a grade lever. I searched your website, typing in the ISBN numbers, and was repeatedly given the message that those products do not exist. When making this phone call, I was put on a long hold, and then given the grade level of one of the 10 items. I was then told that we could figure out the rest of the grade levels by the material taught at each level. I suggested that in order to get that information, I would need to check with another company to see what they provide at each grade level. At that point, I was asked to give the 10 ISBN numbers over the phone, information that should have been available on the computer of the person who had searched for the order number. I was then put on hold for what has now been 20 minutes, and counting, waiting for an answer.

The attachment showed on my sent e-mail but it was at the bottom of the e-mail. Not sure why G-mail does this but it did.

Too many times I have seen schools switch publishers due to the misconception that the materials sat in a book room instead of being use. Providing Marc records enables librarians to promote the use of your materials with the added bonus of having data to show the usage. With tight budget having this data and a librarian to promote the usage of materials are essential to schools. I hope that textbook publishers begin to understand this and start providing the Marc records.

She was helpful, and the feedback I'm about to give has nothing to do with her. She was warm, friendly, and was a pleasure to work with. Instead, my issue is with using your web site. I've had nothing but problems with it whenever I've attempted to use it to complete what should be straightforward tasks - in this case, ordering a desk copy of a textbook I plan to use this coming fall and next spring. I had problems logging in initially - I kept receiving an error message saying that my account had not been set up yet. When I finally succeeded in logging in to request a desk copy, your shopping cart function wouldn't work. I was stuck in an endless loop trying to process the order, which could not be completed. Last year I ran into similar issues (actually far more frustrating, including not being able to create a user account at all), and I could not get a sales rep to return my calls regarding a desk copy; I had to try repeatedly to get through for several weeks. I dread having to use your web site for anything since I can routinely count upon it wasting my time and preventing me from completing tasks, and consequently I avoid using it at all unless absolutely necessary.
